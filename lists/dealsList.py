    "discussion": "Despite the less than admirable spelling of its name, this pillow is a good option for people who need a thin pillow. It is adjustable in height, so you can make it as thin as you need. It is also a great option for side sleepers because of the presence of a cutout that allows your shoulders to align with your head while you sleep on your side.",
