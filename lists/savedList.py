      "description": "One of the problems in the pillow market is that it can be really hard to distinguish between materials, especially when those materials have similar names. Sometimes, the namebrand pillow and the knockoff are made of similar materials. Sometimes they aren't. That's why it can pay to try leveling up. This is a foam pillow that really does feel like it is made with a better quality foam. The difference isn't enormous, but it is there.",
