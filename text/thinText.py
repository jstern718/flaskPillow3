So, while a 1 or 2 inch tall down or down alternative pillow would be perfect to supplement another thin pillow, a 1 or 2 inch foam pillow would be pretty useless on top. It might go on the bottom, but this combination would create a much different head and neck feel than you might otherwise get.";
